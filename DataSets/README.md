# Collecion of datasets
## **netflix_titles_nov_2019.csv**:
 TV Shows and Movies listed on Netflix
 

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings. 
Inspiration

Some of the interesting questions (tasks) which can be performed on this dataset:

- [ ] Understanding what content is available in different countries
- [ ] Identifying similar content by matching text-based features
- [ ] Network analysis of Actors / Directors and find interesting insights
- [ ] Is Netflix has increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years.

Context

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
Content


Attribute Information:
> 1. age
> 2. sex
> 3. chest pain type (4 values)
> 4. resting blood pressure
> 5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
> 6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
> 7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
> 8. maximum heart rate achieved
> 9. exercise induced angina
> 10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
> 11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
> 12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
> 13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.

Inspiration

Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

See if you can find any other trends in heart data to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart health.
